Email or sms spam detection using tenserflow 
With both text and image dataset
I have a dataset in this directory in soam-detection folder alright 
remove the values that doesnt have , ham/spam , and resample the whole dataset so that
model training works flawleselsly
The dataset is present in the data folder , for the text
i wanna train a model so accurately without overfitting such that it classifies all the text perfectly as ham or spam
lets first do this , then i also have the image dataset but lets not talk about it now 
lets focus here
after the model is trained and stored and tested , i wanna implement a flask based app ,just for text  , with a good ui/ux
an elegant theme and extra stuff just to make it look handy
