We have done quite a lot , now i wanna add stuff
as you can see in the data , i have images folder inside that there are ham and spam images
i wanna train a model and after the model is trained  , i wanna have the images classified as spam if +ve
and i should be able to test it in the website as well , so update the settings in the app.py as well
and update the index.html

lets focus here as well , and as i said
after the model is trained and stored and tested , i wanna implement a flask based app ,just for text  , with a good ui/ux
an elegant theme and extra stuff just to make it look handy
